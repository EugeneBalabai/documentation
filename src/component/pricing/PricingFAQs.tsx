        <PricingQuestion question="What are strings?">
          The total amount of localization strings stored in your cloud
          organization, including strings in the base language.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="What are MT credits?">
          MT credits are used for Machine Translation providers (such as Google
          Translate, AWS, DeepL, etc.). One credit ‚ãç 1 translated character.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="What are seats?">
          The number of active users (disabled accounts are not included). When
          self-hosting, the number of users is reported to the Tolgee cloud.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="Do you offer a completely free cloud plan?">
          Absolutely! When you sign up for Tolgee, you will automatically
          receive our Free plan, which is limited by the number of strings and
          MT credits.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="What features are included in the Free plan?">
          The Free plan includes the same features as the Pay as you go plan.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="How does the Pay as you go plan work?">
          The Pay as you go plan comes with a limit of 1,000 strings and 10,000
          monthly MT credits; the MT credits are refilled each month. If you
          exceed the MT credits limit, you will be charged for each extra 1,000
          MT credits. If you exceed the strings limit, you will be charged each
          month for the extra 1,000 strings.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="Can I change my plan?">
          You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. If you upgrade or
          downgrade in the middle of the monthly billing cycle, your account
          will be instantly switched to the new plan, and starting the next
          month the charge will be taken for the chosen plan.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="What happens when I exceed seat or string limits?">
          If you have provided your credit card details, you will be charged
          extra every month. The cost of seats or strings will be determined by
          their weighted average usage during the month.
          <br />
          <br />
          To illustrate, suppose you add an extra seat for half of the month. In
          this case, you will be charged only half the cost of the extra seat
          since the price is weighted by time.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="How do I pay for exceeding limits if I pay annually?">
          If you pay for the service annually, you may still be charged every
          month if you exceed the limits of your plan.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="Does pricing change affect users who already use legacy plans?">
          No. If you are using a legacy plan, you can continue to use it. This
          also applies to legacy free plans.
        </PricingQuestion>

        <PricingQuestion question="What are the seats/strings limitations for the Free self-hosted plan?">
          None. The Free self-hosted plan does not have seats or string
          limitations. However, you must subscribe to a paid plan to use
          advanced features like Granular permissions, CDN, or Webhooks.
        </PricingQuestion>
        <PricingQuestion question="What is the string limit for the self-hosted plans?">
          None. We are not limiting the number of strings in the self-hosted
          instances.

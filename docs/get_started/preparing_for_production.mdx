In production environment, you should never leak your API key. In context must be available just for your translators,
 developers or other stuff, but not to outside world.

:::warning

Never leak your apiKey! We strongly recommend against adding API key into git repository.

:::

To prepare your application for production you will need to let Polygloat use exported .json files.
You can get these files by exporting your translations from web application.
See [exporting translations](web_app/exporting_translations.mdx).

To make Polygloat look for json files, just remove **apiKey** property from configuration object. If we continue on
our [hello world example](hello_world.mdx), production configuration object will look like this:
```javascript
{
    inputPrefix: "{{",
    inputSuffix: "}}",
    watch: true
}
```

In production mode `apiUrl` and `ui` properties are useless as we don't allow anybody to change our translations in the app accessible from outside world.
So we can also remove the `script` tag importing polygloat UI.

Next we should add exported translations into some public path, so Polygloat can reach them.
By default, Polygloat looks for the translation files in `/i18n/[lang].json`.
To change this, you may provide `filesUrlPrefix` property to configuration object, but for out example we can stick with default.

Lets take the exported json files and put them into the i18n directory placed as a sibling of our html file:
```
├── i18n
│   ├── cs.json
│   └── en.json
├── index.html
```

That's it! Our app is ready for production. Here is a final HTML page:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>hello world</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>{{hello_world}}</h1>
</body>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@polygloat/core"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@polygloat/ui"></script>
<script>
const pg = new window["@polygloat/core"].Polygloat({
    inputPrefix: "{{",
    inputSuffix: "}}",
    watch: true,
});
pg.run();
</script>
</html>
```
Now you maybe wish to [add loading overlay](get_started/adding_loading_overlay.mdx), to make untranslated texts invisible.

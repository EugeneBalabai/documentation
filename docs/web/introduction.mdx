import { StackBlitz } from '../../src/component/StackBlitz';

Check our minimal example.

<StackBlitz slug="tolgee-minimal-example" />

If you preview this example you can hold `Alt` key and click the translation, to open tolgee in-context popup.
You can provide your own Tolgee Project API key and in-context will work like a charm.

Notice that we are simply setting `textContent` of div element - no extra wrapping and Tolgee is able to recognize where
the translation is, you can read more about this feature [here](./wrapping).

## The rest is the same as regular i18n library

We've looked at popular i18n libraries and implemented one even better.
We offer all the usual features. Read more [here](./core)

## Integrations

with Tolgee platform everywhere.

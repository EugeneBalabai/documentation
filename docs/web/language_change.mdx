To change language use [`changeLanguage`](../core-package/tolgee#changelanguage) method.

```ts
await tolgee.changeLanguage('es');
```

## Getting current language

When tolgee is running, this will first change `pendingLanguage` property, loads required translation file(s) (when they are not already in the cache) and then changes `language` property.

Use [`getLanguage`](../core-package/tolgee#getlanguage) or [`getPendingLanguage`](../core-package/tolgee#getpendinglanguage) methods to read current state.

You can also listen to `language` and `pendingLanguage` [events](../core-package/events).

> When tolgee is not running `changeLanguage` won't fetch translations, only changes internal state

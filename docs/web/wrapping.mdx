## Invisible wrapping

Tolgee offers unique technology for in-context translating, it combines comfort of simple i18n libraries with
comfort of in-context translating directly in your app.

How it works? Let's take our basic example:

```ts
import { Tolgee, DevTools } from '@tolgee/web';

const tolgee = Tolgee().use(DevTools()).init({
  language: 'en',
  apiUrl: 'https://app.tolgee.io',
  // replace with your Tolgee Project api key to connect to Tolgee
  apiKey: '**********',
});

const myElement = document.createElement('div');
document.body.appendChild(myElement);

myElement.textContent = tolgee.t('test', 'Alt click me');
tolgee.on('keyUpdate', () => {
  myElement.textContent = tolgee.t('test', 'Alt click me');
});

tolgee.run();
```

Let's focus on the main part, where we insert the translation into the dom:

```ts
myElement.textContent = tolgee.t('test', 'Alt click me');
```

Let's try to evaluate the secret by console.logging the result of `t` function:

```ts
console.log(tolgee.t('test'));
// ["t", "e", "s", "t", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]
```

What are these empty characters? They are not actually empty, only invisible
([read more](/blog/2021/12/17/invisible-characters-for-better-localization)).
Tolgee passes a secret information into each translation, which is then detectable in the dom.
We use MutationObserver to check all dom changes and search for these secret characters, to find the exact locations
of translations. This method is very reliable and brings basically no extra effort on the developer side.

We call this mechanism wrapping. You can check the information, which is included with the translation by
calling `tolgee.unwrap` method, which will give you out the information about the translation.

## Why this solution?

We've looked at other solutions which exist for in-context translating and we didn't really liked them.
They are usually too invasive or inpractical, that most people don't use them.
We wanned something which is almost invisible to the developer, but reliable and doesn't break your app.

Because we actually return the translation that should be rendered only with some extra characters, you can
use any custom formatter and modify the string. The secret information should stay where it is as it's a valid
part of the string and if you won't remove it, everything will work as intended.

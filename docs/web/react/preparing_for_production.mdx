In production mode you should never use localization data from Tolgee REST API and you should never leak your API key.
You should use data exported from Tolgee platform.
To get exported localization files, see [exporting translations](platform/exporting_translations.mdx).

There are multiple options to provide static localization data for production builds. Providing a URL prefix where Tolgee can
fetch the data from or providing imported data as reference or provider in TolgeeProvider config prop.

## Providing data using dynamic import (recommended)

To provide your localization data using dynamic import you will need to add providers for every supported language to
TolgeeProvider's configuration property.

```jsx
const tolgee = Tolgee({
  ...
  staticData: {
    en: () => import('./i18n/en.json'),
    de: () => import('./i18n/de.json'),
  }
})
```

Using this approach data will be fetched just when it's needed, so you will save some network traffic.

## Using imported object

```jsx
import * as localeEn from 'i18n/en.json';
import * as localeDe from 'i18n/de.json';

...

const tolgee = Tolgee({
  ...
  staticData: {
    en: localeEn,
    de: localeDe,
  }
})
```

Using this approach, all localization data are bundled with your application, so it will be downloaded with your application code. This approach could be very useful for SSR, when you need your localization data imported to be rendered by your SSR engine.

## Providing data using backend plugin

```jsx
import { BackendFetch } from '@tolgee/react';

const tolgee = Tolgee()
  .use(BackendFetch({ prefix: 'i18n/' }))
  .init({...})
```

[`BackendFetch`](../web-package/plugins#backendfetch) will fetch translation files (en.json, de.json) from `https://<your url>/i18n`, so you don't have to list all the files explicitly.

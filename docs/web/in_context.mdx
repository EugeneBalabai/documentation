For local development, supply `apiUrl`,`apiKey` and `ui` to Tolgee configuration (see [Integration](/docs/platform/integration)). If you set everything properly, you can use in-context translating:

 1. Press and hold `Alt`/`Option` key
 2. Navigate mouse over any translation on your website
 3. It should get highlighted
 4. Click on it to open "Quick translation" dialog
 5. You can edit translations (changes will get stored to Tolgee platform)

## In-context on production

To enable in-context translating on production you can pass `apiKey` and `apiUrl` through [Tolgee Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tolgee-tools/hacnbapajkkfohnonhbmegojnddagfnj) plugin, that way Tolgee will switch to development mode (plugin will also supply `@tolgee/ui` package automatically).

:::warning
Never include `apiKey` in Tolgee configuration on production.
This property is intended only for local development, as it's not meant to be publicly visible.
